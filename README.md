# Data Science Apps with Python
A collection of small data science applications built using Python.

These projects make use of the Streamlit framework. 
Streamlit is a framework that helps turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
It requires very little front-end experience but features a variety of components that can be used quickly.

## The Applications

The dependencies for all projects are stored inside `requirements.txt`. These are installed when the dev container is built. 

To run an application `cd` to its directory and use `streamlit run APPLICATION-NAME.py`.

### List of Applications Includes:
* Stock Price App (View Google stock price and volume of trade.)
* Bioinformatics (Input a DNA sequence and count the number of each nucleotide.)
* Basketball App (Views NBA player stats filtered by team and position.)
* Football App (View NFL player stats with a focus on rushing.)
* Iris Classification App (Input plant properties to get a prediction of the plant's species)
* Penguins Classification App (Input penguin properties to get a prediction of the penguins species)
